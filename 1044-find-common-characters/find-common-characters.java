/*
Given the constraints (only 26 possible characters), the array-based solution is already very efficient. The HashMap approach does not offer a significant advantage in terms of time or space complexity. In fact, the array-based approach may have slightly better constant factors due to the absence of hash map overhead. Therefore, while the HashMap approach is a valid alternative, the array-based solution is likely more efficient and straightforward for this problem.
